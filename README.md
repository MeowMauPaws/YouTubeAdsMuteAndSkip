# YouTubeAdsSkipAndMute - Chrome Extension

## Say Goodbye to Sudden Loud Ads

### Overview

Have you ever been jolted out of your seat by an ad blasting at full volume while you're deep into a YouTube binge? Fear no more! The YouTubeAdsSkipAndMute extension is here to rescue your eardrums and streamline your viewing experience. Our smart tech detects when an ad starts and instantly mutes the video player, then unmutes it as soon as the ad is over. And the cherry on top? It automatically skips those pesky skippable ads for you!

### Features

- **Auto-Mute Ads**: Instantly mutes YouTube ads as soon as they start.
- **Auto-Unmute**: Seamlessly returns to the original volume when the ad finishes.
- **Auto-Skip**: Automatically skips any skippable ads after the mandatory waiting period.

### Installation (For Chrome Users)

The process should be quite similar if you're using another browser like Edge.

1. Click on the three vertical dots icon at the top right corner of your browser.
2. Navigate to 'Extensions' and then select 'Manage extensions'.
3. Enable 'Developer mode' by toggling it on at the top right.
4. Click on 'Load unpacked extension'.
5. Select the folder 'src'.
   - If there are any errors, a warning icon or an 'Errors' button will appear during the loading process.
   - To apply any changes to the source code, remember to hit the reload icon or the 'Update' button to refresh the extension.
